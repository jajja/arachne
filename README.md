# Arachne

Arachne is a simplistic net &amp; spider toolbox. It contains the utilities you might have use for when storing link data mined on the Internet.

## Timeline

Arachne is going to be populated with a selection of restructured utilities that live in the internal system ecology at Jajja.

The project to gather and simplify tools used currently for crawling and handling net resources is ongoing. The current priority is:

* Documentation and examples
* URLs, Parameters (parsing and resolve)
* HTTP, Cookies, Proxies (possibly by wrapping an existing client)
